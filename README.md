# Python Crash Course
### Learning python with a book called [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)

I am learning to code with python with my dad and my brother.

I am going to put my skills that I learn towards the RoboCup robotics competition using Lego Education Spike.

We will commit all projects to this repository.
